# Secure Network Design for eLearning Platforms with Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates how to create a secure network design for a fictional eLearning company, `LearnSec.local`, using Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases best practices for designing a secure environment using firewalls, VLANs, and secure configurations.

## Overview

Building a secure network for an eLearning platform is crucial for protecting sensitive student data. This guide demonstrates how to design a secure network using Cisco Packet Tracer, covering:

- **Secure Network Principles**: Defense-in-depth, least privilege, and more.
- **Network Design**: Firewall configuration, VLAN creation, and IP allocation with VLSM.
- **Security Configurations**: Secure setup of network devices.

---

## Secure Network Design Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), network segmentation, and data encryption for comprehensive security.
- **Least Privilege**: Assign access permissions based on job roles, ensuring users only access the necessary systems and data.
- **Segregation of Duties**: Separate network administration tasks to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Economy of Mechanism**: Use standardized protocols and keep configurations simple.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Configure network devices to deny all traffic by default, allowing only authorized traffic.
- **Complete Mediation**: Implement real-time access controls to validate user permissions for every network resource.
- **Open Design**: Rely on well-established security protocols and best practices for a transparent and secure network architecture.

The network design consists of various components connected for efficient management and security:

- **Router**: Connects LearnSec.localâ€™s network to the internet.

- **Firewall**: Provides internal network security; pfSense firewall is used for ease of configuration.

### Interface Connections

- **Gig0/0/0**: Connects to the internet.
- **Gig0/0/1**: Connects to the firewall.

### Devices and Segments

- **Gig1/1**: Connected to the router.
- **Gig1/2**: Connected to the RADIUS server.
- **Gig1/3**: Connected to the SIEM environment.
- **Gig1/4**: Connected to the DMZ.
- **Gig1/5**: Connected to the inside network (most secure network).
- **Gig1/6**: Security Onion (IDS/IPS).

## Network Segmentation

The network is segmented into VLANs for improved security and manageability, including:

- **Inside Network** (Most Secure)

- **RADIUS Server Network**

## IP Allocation

IP addresses are allocated efficiently using **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)** within the LearnSec.local Class C IP range (192.168.1.0/24). VLSM allows each subnet to have a custom subnet mask to reduce network congestion and waste.

**IP Allocation Table:**

| Device Name         | Interface   | IP Address       | Subnet Mask         |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Router              | gig0/0/1    | 192.168.1.97     | 255.255.255.252     |
| Firewall            | gig1/1      | 192.168.1.98     | 255.255.255.252     |
| RADIUS              | gig1/2      | 192.168.1.101    | 255.255.255.252     |
| SIEM                | gig1/3      | 192.168.1.33     | 255.255.255.224     |
| DMZ                 | gig1/4      | 10.0.0.1         | 255.255.0.0         |
| Inside Network      | gig1/5      | 192.168.1.1      | 255.255.255.224     |
| Security Onion      | gig1/6      | 192.168.1.109    | 255.255.255.252     |
| Web Server          | ethernet    | 10.0.0.2         | 255.255.0.0         |
| Radius Server       | ethernet    | 192.168.1.102    | 255.255.255.252     |
| Security Onion      | ethernet    | 192.168.1.110    | 255.255.255.252     |
| Inside Network      | ethernet    | DHCP (192.168.1.1-192.168.1.30) | 255.255.255.224 |
| SIEM Network        | ethernet    | DHCP (192.168.1.34-192.168.1.62) | 255.255.255.224 |
